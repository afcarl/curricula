## Learn SQL

Letâ€™s dive into SQL! There are a number of SQL guides out there - this one is meant to get you up and running querying data quickly. It focuses primarily on practical use and less on the underlying philosophies of database design and relational algebra. That said, these topics are important to use SQL effectively and responsibly in a real-world environment and should not be overlooked. 


The data in this guide comes from Hubway, Boston's bike sharing service that has open-sourced info on their network.
